# DSA Practice

This projects holds all my thoughts, answered questions, and concepts on data structures and algorithms.


## Run Locally
This project requires that you java version 15 set up on your local machine. You can download and install JDK-15 [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/)

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/adebay8/dsa-practice
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd dsa-practice
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Optimizations

In the future I am hoping to build a visualizer for as many algorithms as possible and have this hosted on a public domain.
